from flask import Blueprint

# Create a blueprint for the routes
main = Blueprint('main', __name__)

# Import routes from other modules
from . import some_route  # Replace 'some_route' with actual route module names as needed
# Add more imports as necessary for additional routes

# Register the blueprint with the main app in app.py
# This will typically be done in the app.py file where the Flask app is initialized.
