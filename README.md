# TrueSight ⚡  
**Revealing the Truth, One Reel at a Time**  

## 🔍 What’s the Problem?  
Social media is flooded with AI-generated content, but checking authenticity *manually* is tedious. TrueSight solves this by:  
✅ **Instant analysis** of shared TikTok/Reel links *in-app*.  
✅ **AI-detection score** (% likelihood) + **explanation** (e.g., "Unnatural eye movement").  
✅ **Zero disruption**—no switching apps or losing your scroll flow.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. **Share** a TikTok/Reel link to TrueSight (via app or extension).  
2. **Get a notification** with:  
   - 🎯 **AI Probability Score** (e.g., "87% likely AI-generated").  
   - 📝 **Key Reasons** (e.g., "Inconsistent lip-sync, synthetic background").  
3. **Keep scrolling**—no interruptions!
